          This disease prediction model is based on Random forest algorithm with
          almost 95% accuracy. This is a minor project. Please donâ€™t rely fully upon this for your diagnose as thereâ€™s more to evolve for
          this project to give accurate information related to the disease. We suggest to consult with doctors if the symptoms are quite serious.
